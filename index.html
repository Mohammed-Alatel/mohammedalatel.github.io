        <h2>First post</h2>
        <h6>2018 i start my first time to Web develpment and i start with HTML and CSS.</h6>
        
        <p>After deciding I wanted to get into web development the first question on my mind was “What do I learn?” After doing some research, I ended up making my learning path based on what most entry-level web developer positions asked for, which was HTML & CSS and JavaScript </p>

The goal you want to achieve</h6>
        
        <p>
After a race with time, I finished the part that I had selected and moved to the next part. I found out how difficult it was and set the right time for it. So, I repeat this method. Even if I was exhausted, I set myself a half-hour break. Until I finished studying the material. This method saved me a lot of time testing days, and also saved me from stress. I felt like the time was right for me to focus, unlike my girlfriend who had tickets all day but was lost because of distractions during the day. Fiumi was between study and rest and sometimes fun.
When you grew up I learned that when you want to write a goal you want to achieve, it must be this goal:
1. Measurable
2. A reality that can be achieved
3. It is specific at a specific time</p>
